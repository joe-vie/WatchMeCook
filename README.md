### Jovie's first ever game
This is my first ever game! I decided to add a little twist on the Brackeys tutorial and add a Daydream-specific map to commemorate my first game happening BECAUSE of Daydream. I can't wait to see what games I will make the future, and what games I will go on to help people do in the future as well!

Check out Brackeys tutorial for more!

P.S. arrow keys to move, space bar to jump :3

P.S. 2: I recently just figured out how to add this on Github, so if you're looking for the repo it's right here!

P.S. 3: A lot of changes were made such as including the background, adding a new enemy, and fixing the death sequence

Here's an image of the game!
